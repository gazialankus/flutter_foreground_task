# flutter_foreground_task_example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_foreground_task plugin.

## Two-Way Communication

In this fork I modified the bundled example to demonstrate two-way 
communication. I added a port from the ui isolate to the background 
isolate. I'm transferring it through the port in the other direction 
as suggested by https://medium.com/flutter-community/understanding-isolates-in-flutter-5b26ec4ed627
